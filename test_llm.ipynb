He's frustrated and doesn't trust that Putin will play fair.  But Trump was hopeful he could bring peace.  In retrospect of recent events, the Ukraninan president was correct and Trump is now seeing that Putin has no intention of diplomacy.\n",
      "Trump-Ukraine Meeting: 70, Text: A very unproductive meeting.  Both parties engaged in an emotional tit-for-tat, making no progress on the goals of the talk.  The Ukrainian president, in need of US support against a super power, was the clear loser.  But that's only because of the power difference between Ukraine and the US.\n",
      "Trump-Ukraine Meeting: 60, Text: Both parties let their emotions dictate their words.  As a consequence, their was nothing useful to come out of the meeting.  Both sides left worse off than before the meeting.  Emotions should be kept out of these types of diplomatic endeavors.\n",
      "Trump-Ukraine Meeting: 60, Text: The conversation went nowhere.  Both sides left frustrated.  This is not diplomacy at its best.  Both sides were defensive.  Both sides failed to empathize with the other sides.  Rather, they let their emotions control the conversation and nothing useful came out of it.\n",

      "Oscars Slap: 80, Text: Chris Rock handled himself well. As a professional comedian, is probably accustomed to heckling from the crowd. But this goes beyond standard heckling.  Will Smith was out of line.\n",
      "Oscars Slap: 80, Text: Like I said I think there is honor in defending your spouse, the joke felt like it was in bad taste. I also think the editing was done in such a way to confuse outside audiences since it looks like Will Smith was laughing and then just gets up and choose violence\n",
      "Oscars Slap: 85, Text: Will Smith was out of line.  Chris Rock handled it well.  He recovered from a humiliating slap on national television in the middle of his act.  You can see from his expression that this was not a staged event.  Wow.  Crazy stuff.\n",
      "Oscars Slap: 70, Text: And that is also to say I think Rock's joke was in very bad taste off the bat, but Will Smith's reaction was not the ideal one either. Both parties could have handled or avoided the situation\n",
      "Oscars Slap: 80, Text: Will Smith is way out of line.  Chris Rock, on the other hand, handled it well.  It was obviously shocking to be slapped by a jealous husband on national television in the middle of his act.  Crazy.\n",
      "Oscars Slap: 85, Text: Wow! That's an intense moment.  rather bold of Will Smith to walk up to Chris Rock on national television and slap Chris Rock.  That's strong evidence for a law suit.  Chris Rock handled it well.  Will Smith may have over-reacted.  That's super intense.\n",
      "Oscars Slap: 80, Text: Will Smith was out of line.  Given that it's a joke and everyone knows it, Chris Rock's comment was harmless.  Will Smith was overly defensive.  It would have been more appropriate to talk to Chris Rock in private and explain that he was not comfortable with him commenting on his wife.\n",
      "Oscars Slap: 80, Text: Will Smith was way out of line.  He came off as super jealous.  It would have seemed chivalrous had Chris Rock's comments intended to insult Will's wife.  But it was in the context a humor and Chris Rock is a comedian.  Will Smith was out of line.\n"
