In addition to extracting ml features, my team members may want to add some EDA into the pipeline.  Is it best to include that here by, for example, adding an eda activity as a "feature extraction" activity?  Or, should this be in a different pipeline?

Use cases:
* A team member has developed some EDA code that they want to run every time we run the pipeline.  How would they include this?
