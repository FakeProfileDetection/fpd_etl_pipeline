# Prompt 2

1) stage 04_extract_ml_features.py currently extracts features for non-deep learning ml.  We will add feature extraction for additional ML and analysis tasks.  However, we don't know what all of these are yet.   When we do add more feature extraction types, we'd like to add these to the pipeline without re-processing all the existing data.  How does your system handle this?
