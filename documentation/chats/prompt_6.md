# Prompt 6

Each type of cleaning/extraction has unique artifacts.   At the moment, these artifacts are extracted using the scrips, which we'll need to refactor to work with the pipeline.

Use case:
* Our data will be used for experiments, whose results will be reported in one or more research papers.  Details about the dataset, extraction, etc. are important.  
* We also plan to publish our data and code.  While the data is not yet published (because we need to clean out any PII), the code base is all open source and will remain open source.
* Although public, uur team members are the target users.  

Are there any other considerations regarding best practices?
