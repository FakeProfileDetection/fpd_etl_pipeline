TikTok: TikTok limits comments to 150 characters, including hashtags. You can utilize the speech-to-text feature on most smartphones to dictate a comment and stay within the character limit, according to CharacterCounter.COM and the University of Rochester.
Instagram: While Instagram allows for much longer comments (up to 2,200 characters), it's recommended to keep comments around 125-150 characters to ensure the comment is fully visible without the user needing to click "see more". You can also use speech-to-text on most smartphones to create comments on Instagram without typing.
Facebook: Facebook has a generous comment limit of 8,000 characters. However, to ensure optimal engagement, it's advised to keep comments shorter, perhaps within the 150-character range or even shorter. Speech-to-text functionality can be used here as well.
Utilizing Speech-to-Text Features: Many smartphones and operating systems have built-in speech-to-text features that allow you to convert spoken words into text without needing to type on a keyboard. You can activate this feature within the social media app's comment section (often by tapping on a microphone icon on the keyboard) and dictate your comment.
