Hello world.  This is me again.  This time, i've implemented a wasm (WebAssembly) app for the keystroke capture components.  This is because the actual keystroke capture components showed significant delays caused by processing. This effectively mean that keystroke timestamps did not reflect the time user's pressed/released a key, but rather the time it was processed, which could be delayed significantly and is likely the cause of the PP, RR errors we say in the data.
