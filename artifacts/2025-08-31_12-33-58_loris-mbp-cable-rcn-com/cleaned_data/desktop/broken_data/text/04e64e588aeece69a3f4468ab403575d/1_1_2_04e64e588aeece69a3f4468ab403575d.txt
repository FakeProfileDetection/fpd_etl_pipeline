Coach Carter's own son, Damien, is a key figure in this scene.  He could have easily left to play at another school, but he chose to stay and support his father. His presence gives the scene a deeply personal feel. He shows his teammates that this is not just a coach's crazy plan, but a genuine belief in education and a willingness to stand for a cause. Itâ€™s a powerful subplot about a son who respects his father's values more than his own athletic ambitions. FamilyLegacy ComingOfAge MoralCompass
