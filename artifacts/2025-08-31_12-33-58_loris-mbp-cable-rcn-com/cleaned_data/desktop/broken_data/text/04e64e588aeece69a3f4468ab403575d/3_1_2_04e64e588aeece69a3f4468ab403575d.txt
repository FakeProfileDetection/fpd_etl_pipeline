The movie and this scene in particular teach a powerful lesson in self-worth that goes beyond basketball.  In a community where basketball scholarships are seen as the only ticket out, Coach Carter teaches his players that their worth is not tied to their athletic abilities. He forces them to look inward and realize that their intellect and their futures are far more valuable than any game they could ever win. #SelfWorth #Inspiration #FutureIsBright
