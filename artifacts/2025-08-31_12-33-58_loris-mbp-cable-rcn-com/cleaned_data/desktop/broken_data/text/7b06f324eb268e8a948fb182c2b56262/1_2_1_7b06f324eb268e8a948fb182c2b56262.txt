Watching the Oscars clip where Will Smith slapped Chris Rock was intense and honestly a bit uncomfortable. It was one of those moments that instantly became bigger than just a celebrity incident - it sparked global conversations about respect, boundaries, emotional control, and public behavior. I could see that Will was clearly emotional, especially since the joke involved his wife, but it still didn't feel right to see violence play out live on such a massive stage. At the same time, I think it reminded people that celebrities are human too, with limits and breaking points. It's easy to judge, but harder to understand what someone might be going through in that moment. I don't condone what happened, but I also don't think it's black and white. This clip left me reflecting on how we react under pressure and how important it is to choose dialogue over impulse - especially in public.
