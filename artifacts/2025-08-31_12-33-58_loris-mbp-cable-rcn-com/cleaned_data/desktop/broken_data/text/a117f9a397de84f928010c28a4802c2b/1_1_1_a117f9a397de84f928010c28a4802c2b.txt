Touching and memorable.  When the student stands up and says that we are not afraid of our inadequacies but, essentially, a ffraid that others will be frightened of our skills.  This is very true.  My own experience includes others sabotaging me because i'm better, more motivated, and have more integrity than them.  But I haven't had the same experience regarding others feeling librated around me because of my own liberation.  Rather, people feel threatened by my success and still aim to destroy it.  Nevertheless, I learned how to survive and shine despite this.
