Coach Carter was an inspirational person in the lives of these young men.  I did not see the full movie. But from what I know about sports, the students were probably failing their classes and Coach Carter was trying to inspire them to do more than just the sport.  This is wise because an education opens more doors than sports and not all of the players will make a successful career as professional players. Even those who do will benefit from a solid educations.
