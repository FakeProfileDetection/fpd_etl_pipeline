For many, the slap was a textbook example of toxic masculinity.  The act was interpreted as a man resorting to violence to "defend" his wife in a way that was both aggressive and performative. The event was dissected through the lens of gender roles and societal expectations for men. It sparked a conversation about how men are taught to react to perceived disrespect and how those reactions can be harmful, not just to others but to themselves and their public image. #ToxicMasculinity #GenderRoles #Behavior
