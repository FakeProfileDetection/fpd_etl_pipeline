We should try some really long posts to test the bounds of the file size.  I mean really long.  Long like an essay type long.  But, of course, not too long because we really don't expect participants to invest hours on an app that they only get paid $10 for.  While $10 may be a lot for someone without a college degree or years invested into developing a trade or skill, it's still $10 and $10 is can still buy something...although, the value of the dollar is shrinking these days.  But you could probably by a lot of Subway sandwiches for $10.  OK.  Maybe not a lot.  Probably two.  But if you want a drink, maybe you could only buy one Subway sandwich and some chips and a drink and possibly a cookie. (But if you can't afford more than one meal, we you really want to waste your money on junk food?). Anyways, this is a fairly long post already.  Maybe I should stop now.
