One of the most significant outcomes of this high-level meeting was the announced plan for a future peace summit.  President Trump has reportedly begun arrangements for a face-to-face meeting between Presidents Putin and Zelenskyy, with his administration playing the role of a mediator. This is a monumental step forward and signals a potential new phase in the long-running conflict, offering a glimmer of hope that a diplomatic solution could be within reach. #PeaceSummit #WorldAffairs #UkraineWar
