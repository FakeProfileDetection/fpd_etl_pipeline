Anyone who has recently seen an unedited clip of the Oscar's slap, was I the only one who fell for the Mandela Effect here, or did a lot of other people remember it as Will Smith yelling from his seat before he went up on stage and slapped Chris Rock?  I don't think I'd ever watched the full video, but I swear I remembered it the other way around.
