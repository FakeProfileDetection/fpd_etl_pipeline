This speech gave me chills the first time I heard it… still does every time I rewatch it. Pure motivation.He didn’t just coach basketball… he coached life. We all needed a Coach Carter growing up.That moment when Timo Cruz recites the quote… absolute chills. One of the greatest scenes in movie history
