After watching this scene gave me chill. It made me realize that sometimes we hold ourselves back not because we are not good enough, but because we are afraid of how great we could be. I loved how the character recognized the coach impact and thanked him. That moment felt real and emotional. It also remind me that true leadership changes live.
