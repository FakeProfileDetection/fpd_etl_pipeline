This video really struck a chord with me. The way the character delivered those words "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure" gave me chills. It's something I never really thought about, but it's true. Sometimes we hold ourselves back because we're afraid of what might happen if we actually succeed. The speech felt raw, real, and deeply empowering. I found myself nodding through the whole thing, realizing how often I shrink myself just to fit in. But what if we let ourselves shine fully? What if we allowed our strengths to show without fear of being "too much"? This scene reminded me that playing small doesn't help anyone - not ourselves and definitely not those around us. We can inspire others just by being brave enough to be our full selves. I needed this reminder today
