The movie clip from Coach Carter was inspirational! It contains a quote "our deepest fear..."  It tells us that one's deepest fears are not that one would fail but that one would succeed and let other's unconsciously succeed in their lives. This quote originates from a spiritual teacher 'Marianne Willamson' from her book 'Return To Love'.
