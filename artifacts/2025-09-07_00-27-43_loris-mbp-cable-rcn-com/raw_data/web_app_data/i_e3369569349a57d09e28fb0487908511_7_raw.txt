Zelensky seems to be in ego that I am the President of a nation that is going head-on with a Superpower nation, and I don't fear anyone. Whereas Trump is in his ego that I am the president of a nation that IS the greatest nation, and I don't listen to anyone, and others should listen to me. When egos are brought to the table. It's bound to happen.
