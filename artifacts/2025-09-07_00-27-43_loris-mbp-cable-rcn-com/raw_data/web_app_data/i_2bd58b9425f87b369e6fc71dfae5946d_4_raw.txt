I loved Will Smith's reaction to the comment about Jada onstage honestly. I don't know what exactly it was about but sounded kinda vulgar. I'm so glad he went up there and stood up for her. More men need to do this in this day and age. I don't think he should've been banned from the oscars for just standing up for his wife.
