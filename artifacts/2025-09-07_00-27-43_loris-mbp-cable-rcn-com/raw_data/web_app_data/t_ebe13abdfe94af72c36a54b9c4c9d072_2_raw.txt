Coach Carter has this amazing quote "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us." I keep coming back to this. What a great way to establish self-respect without being cheekily arrogant.
