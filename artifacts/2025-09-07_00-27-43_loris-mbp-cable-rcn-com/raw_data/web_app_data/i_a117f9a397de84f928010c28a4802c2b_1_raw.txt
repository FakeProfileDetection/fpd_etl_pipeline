It's inspiring to see the students inspired by their coach.  It's interesting to consider how the team bans together to support the coach by making themselves better.  I have not seen the full movie, but I gather that something happened before that led to the breaking point that brought the students to sink or swim.  I see the coach carrying a box as he left.  My guess is he was fired.
