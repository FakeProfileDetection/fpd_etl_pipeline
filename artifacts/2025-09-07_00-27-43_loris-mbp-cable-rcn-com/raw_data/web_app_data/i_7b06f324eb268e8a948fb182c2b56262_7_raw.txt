Watching the Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump, Senator J.D. Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy felt like witnessing history in motion. The atmosphere was tense yet diplomatic, with Zelenskyy calmly presenting Ukraine's ongoing need for support in the face of Russian aggression. Trump's tone was measured but skeptical, emphasizing accountability and America-first priorities. Senator Vance added a voice that reflected the growing divide in U.S. politics about foreign aid and national interest. What stood out most was Zelenskyy's persistence-his quiet determination to represent his war-torn nation and maintain crucial international alliances. The meeting brought into focus deeper questions: How far should the U.S. go to support its allies? What role does empathy play in foreign policy? Whether you agree with the stances taken or not, it was a moment that highlighted the complexity of diplomacy in today's world-and the real human consequences that come with every political decision.
