Great.  14 of 18.  I'm almost home.  Yes.  No errors.  OK. Maybe there's an error.  But I don't see any errors.  There's got to be an error somewhere.  There's got to be something wrong. There's got to be an issue.  There's got to be a problem.  What's up?  Nothing is wrong.  I was hoping something would be wrong.
