Honestly, the slap at the oscars was kind of deserved. I'm totally on Will Smith's side on this entire debacle. The comment made onstage about Jada had extremely vulgar undertones even though I don't know exactly what it was about. I'm honestly glad he stood up for his wife and I wished more men did.
