Coach Carter is such an inspirational movie! I was so moved by the monologue by the curly haired guy (forgot his name oops) I wish to be such a good orator one day. Also made me ponder the impact a good teacher can have on their students, students are so vulnerable and can be moulded so easily. Would highly recommend everyone to watch, especially people who are in a rut and want to feel part of a bigger purpose
