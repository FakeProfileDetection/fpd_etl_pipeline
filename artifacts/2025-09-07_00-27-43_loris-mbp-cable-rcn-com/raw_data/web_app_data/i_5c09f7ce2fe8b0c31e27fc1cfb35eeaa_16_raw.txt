Around this time last year, I made the mistake of watching "Barbie" and then "Poor Things" in the same weekend, and on Sunday night I had terribly vivid dreams of the two stories melting together into one.  Today, even though it wasn't exactly my choice, I had to watch the video of Donald Trump making an ass of himself in a meeting with Zelensky, and also a clip of Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.  It's almost midnight for me, and I'm actually looking forward to having the same kind of fevered dream this time around.
