A great motivational movie based on real life. It truly shows that it's not the fear of failure that keeps us from trying, but deep down it's the fear of being successful that scares us. We are only bounded by our imaginations and courage. If we build up the courage to face our deepest fears, no once can stop us from achieving from what we want in life.
