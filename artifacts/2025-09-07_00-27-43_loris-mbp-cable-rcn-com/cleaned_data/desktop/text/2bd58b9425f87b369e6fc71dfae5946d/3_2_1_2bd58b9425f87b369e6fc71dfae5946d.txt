So glad Will Smith stood up for his wife on stage on the oscars tonight. More men need to do this in this day and age honestly. I don't think he deserved to get banned from the oscars because of this. I don't know what the comment was about it sounded extremely vulgar. I don't know how such a comment could be made onstage.
