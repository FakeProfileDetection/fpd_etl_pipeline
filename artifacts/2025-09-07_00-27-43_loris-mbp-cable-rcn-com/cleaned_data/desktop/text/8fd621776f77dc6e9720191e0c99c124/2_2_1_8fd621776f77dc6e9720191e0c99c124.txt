People should learn self-control. And it is crazy how the temperament of a person can change that fast, 2 seconds before he was laughing along with others, 2 seconds later, he is slapping the host. CRAZY!!!!! But I guess the jokes can be discussed beforehand if that is the reaction some words can illicit out of people.
