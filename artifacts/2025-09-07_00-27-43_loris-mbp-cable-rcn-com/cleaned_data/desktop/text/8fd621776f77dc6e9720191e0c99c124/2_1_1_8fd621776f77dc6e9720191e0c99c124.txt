When you find a good mentor who guides you and teaches you, they become a supporter for life. Self-doubt is our greatest enemy. No one can resolve it for you unless you are ready to resolve it yourself. Sometimes you have the will but not the means. So if you come across a person who is willing to help you, and in turn, you are also willing to work, it is the greatest boon. This would lessen or even erase your self-inflicted demons.
