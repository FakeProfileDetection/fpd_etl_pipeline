I can tell you that I have nothing to do with coach carrter and I dont care what he says in the video. There is a lot of coaches nowadays spreading no research based junk all over the internet.. who to follow who not to follow is my biggest dilemma, this is insane that knowledge has become so cheap and also too much that we are unable to consume knowledge as fast as we are producing... it .. think GPT is producing so much knowlege... think who is going to consume it . .humans... well they have a limit theyt cant adatp to anythng always ,.. we are at a tipping point
