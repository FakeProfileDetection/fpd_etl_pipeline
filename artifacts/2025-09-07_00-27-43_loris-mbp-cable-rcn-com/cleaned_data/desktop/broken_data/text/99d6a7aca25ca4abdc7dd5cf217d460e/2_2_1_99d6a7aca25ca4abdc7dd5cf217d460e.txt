mojis: This is the most common and straightforward approach. You can express a wide range of emotions or reactions using a single emoji or a combination of them.
Examples:
To show admiration for a photo: 😍✨
To express laughter: 😂🤣
To indicate a positive reaction or agreement: 👍🔥
For love or affection: ❤️🥰
Invisible characters: Some online tools and generators allow you to create and copy "invisible" characters (like zero-width or non-breaking spaces) that can be pasted into Instagram comments, making them appear blank.
Note: While this is technically possible, it might not be the most engaging or communicative way to interact with a post.
