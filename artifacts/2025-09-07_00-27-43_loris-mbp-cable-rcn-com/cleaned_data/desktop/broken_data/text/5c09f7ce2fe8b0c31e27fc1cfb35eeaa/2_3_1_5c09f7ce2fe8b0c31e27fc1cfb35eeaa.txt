I had to watch that disgraceful clip of the White House meeting with Zelensky again, since I guess Donald Trump didn't ever actually convince his hero to end the invasion on Day 1.  The only bright side to that video, though, is seeing how legibly an Eastern European manages to speak in English, even when he doesn't have a slobbering oaf next to him for comparison's sake.
