Summary
I've created the core scripts for your FPD ETL Pipeline. Here's what's been generated:
1. Setup & Configuration

setup_project.py - Creates directory structure, git hooks, and initial config
.env.base configuration template
Git safety hooks to prevent data commits

2. Core Utilities

scripts/utils/version_manager.py - Version tracking and management
scripts/utils/config_manager.py - Configuration loading and management
scripts/utils/cloud_artifact_manager.py - Cloud storage integration

3. Pipeline Scripts

scripts/pipeline/run_pipeline.py - Main orchestrator with safe defaults
scripts/pipeline/stage_template.py - Template for implementing stages

4. Standalone Tools

scripts/standalone/upload_artifacts.py - Upload after local review
scripts/standalone/download_artifacts.py - Download team artifacts
scripts/dev_workflow.sh - Convenient development commands

5. Documentation

QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Quick command reference

Key Features Implemented
✅ Safe Defaults

No uploads without --upload-artifacts flag
PII excluded without --include-pii flag
Confirmation prompts for risky operations

✅ Version Management

Unique version IDs with timestamp and hostname
Version tracking in versions.json
Support for derived versions

✅ Cloud Integration

Google Cloud Storage support
Local caching of downloaded artifacts
Manifest tracking for all artifacts

✅ Development Friendly

Local-only mode for development
Dry-run option
Helper scripts for common workflows

Next Steps with Claude Code
To continue implementation with Claude Code:

Implement the actual pipeline stages by copying stage_template.py:

01_download_data.py - Download from GCS
02_clean_data.py - Your cleaning logic
03_extract_keypairs.py - Keypair extraction
04_extract_features.py - Feature extraction orchestrator


Create feature extractors in features/extractors/:

Base class implementation
TypeNet ML features
Feature registry


Add EDA reports in eda/reports/:

Base report class
Data quality reports
Custom analysis


Update imports in run_pipeline.py to use actual stages instead of placeholders

The placeholders include TODO comments that Claude Code can recognize and help complete. All the infrastructure is in place - you just need to add your specific data processing logic.
